  <h2>Course Description</h2>
  <p>Unlike a well-controlled experiment, science does not take place in a vacuum. Human relationships, institutions, political opinion, worldview, money (obviously), and
    writing practices (perhaps not as obviously?) participate in the shaping and proliferation of scientific knowledge.
    Reading and analysis of essays on scientific topics written for a general audience, and practice writing such as essays.
    Writing for non-scientists about specialized scientific work.</p>
<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>The following learning outcomes must be met:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compose in academic, professional, and/or workplace genres related to a field of study.</li>
  <li>Apply writing processes common to that field.</li>
  <li>Compose and deliver a professional presentation.</li>

<h2>Policies</h2>
<h3>Attendance Policy</h3>
<p>You may be absent from class without an excuse three times this semester without penalty to your grade. After that, each additional unexcused absence will lower your grade by one letter.
  If you need to be excused from class for the day, you must inform me in advance.</p>
<h3>Late Work</h3>
<p>If you need an extension on a paper, you must inform me in advance. Late work will not be accepted without an extension.</p>
<h3>Drafting</h3>
<p>All writing in this class is the product of drafting and revision. If you fail to turn in a draft on time, you will not receive comments from your peers. A final
  draft that is not the product of a peer-review/revision cycle will be graded one letter lower than the quality of the work.</p>
<h3>Academic Dishonesty</h3>
<p>Please familiarize yourself with the University’s Academic Integrity policy, which can be found at <a href="https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/integrity.html">
  https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/integrity.html</a>. In a writing course, we are particularly concerned with plagiarism, which the catalog describes as
  “Copying or receiving material from any source and submitting that material as one’s own, without acknowledging and citing the particular debts to the source
  (quotations, paraphrases, basic ideas), or in any other manner representing the work of another as one’s own.” The writing program’s policy states that the
  first instance of plagiarism will result in an “F” on that assignment. Any additional instances of plagiarism will result in failure of the course.</p>
<h3>Incompletes</h3>
<p>An incomplete grade may only be given to students who have (1) fulfilled the attendance requirement for the course and (2) completed all
  but one of the written assignments.</p>
