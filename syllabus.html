  <h2>Course Description</h2>
  <p>Unlike a well-controlled experiment, science does not take place in a vacuum. Human relationships, institutions, political opinion, worldviews, money (obviously), and
    writing practices (perhaps not as obviously?) participate in the shaping and proliferation of scientific knowledge.
    Reading and analysis of essays on scientific topics written for a general audience, and practice writing such as essays.
    Writing for non-scientists about specialized scientific work.</p>
