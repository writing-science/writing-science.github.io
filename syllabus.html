  <h2>Course Description</h2>
  <p>Unlike a well-controlled experiment, science does not take place in a vacuum. Human relationships, institutions, political opinion, worldview, money (obviously), and
    writing practices (perhaps not as obviously?) participate in the shaping and proliferation of scientific knowledge.
    Reading and analysis of essays on scientific topics written for a general audience, and practice writing such as essays.
    Writing for non-scientists about specialized scientific work.</p>
<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>The following learning outcomes must be met:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compose in academic, professional, and/or workplace genres related to a field of study.</li>
  <li>Apply writing processes common to that field.</li>
  <li>Compose and deliver a professional presentation.</li>
  <li>Describe the conventions of genres within a field.</li>
  <li>Make effective disciplinary and professional arguments.</li>
  <li>Understand and apply visual and digital composing methods as appropriate to the field.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Required Materials</h2>
<h3>Books</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fish, Stanley. <i>How to Write a Sentence and How to Read One</i>. Harper, 2012. ISBN: 9780061840531</li>
  <li>Alred, Gerald, et al. <i>The Business Writer's Handbook</i>. 12th ed., Bedford/St. Martin's, 2020. ISBN: 9781319058494 (print), 9781319368661 (electronic)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> You may acquire your books in whatever manner and medium is most accessible and available to you. However, each of these books
  may be easier to use in print format (though for very different reasons).</p>
<h3>Electronic Resources</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Google products: Our video class will convene via Google Meet; peer reviewing will occur over Google Docs; important dates will be dispersed on Google Calendar.</li>
  <li>Slack: This app is common in workplace environments. Those who market it and invest in it claim it may overtake email someday (though this is of course debatable).
    It is highly likely you will encounter it in your future professional endeavors, so we will be deploying it in our class. It is, essentially, a secure group chat
    application. You may ask general questions about the course, share helpful links, or anything else you see fit. Helping your peers there is highly encouraged.
    You may also privately message me there, free from some of the formal constraints of emailing (constraints we will be talking about in class, by the way).</li>
  <li>UBLearns: Here you will document your work for the class using the UBLearns portfolio. Grades and FERPA-protected information will also be communicated here.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<h3>Assignments</h3>
<p><em>Cover Letter:</em> Cover letters are a way to communicate your suitability for a position to potential employers. You will write one to me, explaining your prior
  knowledge of and experience with writing professionally, and &ldquo;pitching&rdquo; your suitability for this course.</p>
<p><em>Memos:</em> With the emergence of email, this genre has become out-of-date, but it is the form of workplace communication email was modeled after. Studying memos
  will afford us an opportunity to consider how genres change over time, as well as how older genres continue to influence current ones. They are also a simple way to
  start considering how documents are designed.</p>
<p><em>Usability Study:</em> Usability studies, as the name implies, are documents that attempt to account for how usable something is. Whether that &ldquo;something&rdquo;
  is a website, a car, or a surgical tool, usability studies provide information about how it is used &mdash; does it function as intended? is it approachable? is it
  deployed in surprising ways? In a small group, you will conduct a usability study and document your findings. In addition to the written document, you will present your
  findings in a group <em>presentation</em>. You will also file a <em>progress report</em> to me along the way, informing me about how your group project is going,
  and what successes and difficulties you have encountered along the way.</p>
<p><em>Marketing Report:</em> Companies use social media differently. Acting as a consultant for an imaginary company, you will prepare a report documenting some
  best practices for their social media campaigns. You will research how corporate social media accounts develop their &ldquo;brand,&rdquo; both in the field
  (by observing what real social media accounts post) and theoretically (by consulting secondary research on social media management).</p>
<p><em>Portfolio Submission:</em> In anticipation of the <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/ubcurriculum/capstone.html">UB Capstone Course</a>, students of this course
  must submit at least one piece of writing to their portfolio on UBLearns. You are encouraged to submit more than one piece of writing, and you may earn extra credit
  for writing a reflection on this course accompanying your submission.</p>
<p><em>Participation:</em> Participation is a significant component of this course. Though it is certainly more natural to have active, engaged conversations when
  we occupy the same room, it is still vitally important for your own success and our success as a class that you speak up, and often. As in the professional world,
  you have to get noticed to get ahead here. It is expected that you come to class having read what was assigned for the day, that you voice your opinions on what you
  have read, and that you respond in a kind, thoughtful manner to the insights of your peers.</p>
<h2>Policies</h2>
<h3>Attendance Policy</h3>
<p>You may be absent from class without an excuse three times this semester without penalty to your grade. After that, each additional unexcused absence will lower your grade by one letter.
  If you need to be excused from class for the day, you must inform me in advance.</p>
<h3>Late Work</h3>
<p>If you need an extension on a paper, you must inform me in advance. Late work will not be accepted without an extension.</p>
<h3>Drafting</h3>
<p>All writing in this class is the product of drafting and revision. If you fail to turn in a draft on time, you will not receive comments from your peers. A final
  draft that is not the product of a peer-review/revision cycle will be graded one letter lower than the quality of the work.</p>
<h3>Academic Dishonesty</h3>
<p>Please familiarize yourself with the University’s Academic Integrity policy, which can be found at <a href="https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/integrity.html">
  https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/integrity.html</a>. In a writing course, we are particularly concerned with plagiarism, which the catalog describes as
  “Copying or receiving material from any source and submitting that material as one’s own, without acknowledging and citing the particular debts to the source
  (quotations, paraphrases, basic ideas), or in any other manner representing the work of another as one’s own.” The writing program’s policy states that the
  first instance of plagiarism will result in an “F” on that assignment. Any additional instances of plagiarism will result in failure of the course.</p>
<h3>Incompletes</h3>
<p>An incomplete grade may only be given to students who have (1) fulfilled the attendance requirement for the course and (2) completed all
  but one of the written assignments.</p>
